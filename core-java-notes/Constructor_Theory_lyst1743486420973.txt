Constructor Theory : 

Constructor is an special type of method but does not have any return type (not even void)
suppose if we provide any return type to the constructor then it will become method
Constructor have the same name as class name because when we create an object of the class Constructor will get automatically called. or(constructor have the information of the whole class)
suppose we can't declared any constructor in our program then system(compiler) will provide the default constructor 
suppose we write any constructor then system will not provide any constructor.
Imp of Constructor : suppose if you want to execute anything before an method then that code write inside the Constructor
we can write multiple constructor in single class
Constructor cannot be static 
we can give any access specifier to the Constructor 

there are two types of Constructor :

1. Argument / Parameterised 
2. No-Argument / Non-Parameterised




refer these code : 


package com.tka;

public class Employee 
{

//	access specifier / className Car(){
//
//	}
	
	 static {
		System.out.println("These is Static-Block");
	}
	
    {	
		System.out.println("These is Non-Static Block");
	}
	

	public Employee() {
		System.out.println("These is Constructor...");
	}
	
	public void m1() {
		System.out.println("These is Method...");
	}

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Employee e = new Employee();
		e.m1();
	}

}


Output : 

These is Static-Block
These is Non-Static Block
These is Constructor...
These is Method...
